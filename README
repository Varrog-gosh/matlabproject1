This is project 1.
TODO:
* Equivalenz steepest decent == euler
* only one solution for cubic equation for alpha
* plots again with shading (read instructions carvefully)
* why is for steepst method with constant alpha not stable for large alpha?
* description for results
* run with time
* change in newton-steepest potente to get optimal time (i will do that)
