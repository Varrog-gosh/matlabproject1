This is project 1.
Questions: 
	what are our canditade numbers?
	is the formular for alpha correct?
	should we really use the discriminant \Delta for seeing that there is only one real root for alpah?
		this is a lot of work
	are the calculations in our protocol enought, or do we need more?

Bugs: 
	in improved steepest decent: after a few iterations alpha gets to small, and there are no more changes in the residual
