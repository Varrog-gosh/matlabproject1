This is project 1.

TODO:
* Equivalenz steepest decent == euler
* only one solution for cubic equation for alpha
* plots again with surf (as mentioned in task g)
* compare newton with steepest for large |x-x_{zero}|
* why is for steepst method with constant alpha not stable for large alpha?
* time for 20 iterations and time for 1000 iterations
* change in newton-steepest potente to get optimal time (i will do that)
* pictures with better resolution
