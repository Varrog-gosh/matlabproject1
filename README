This is project 1.

TODO:
* Equivalenz steepest decent == euler
* only one solution for cubic equation for alpha

done:
* why is for steepst method with constant alpha not stable for large alpha?
* change in newton-steepest potente to get optimal time (i will do that)
* time for 20 iterations and time for 1000 iterations
* compare newton with steepest for large |x-x_{zero}|
