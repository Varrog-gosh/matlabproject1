This is project 1.
TODO:
* plots with residuals new, because first relative residual should be 1.
* gvalues.pdf new with log scala
* new run time, because the improved steepest method didnt work probably. If alpha_optimal is only given at the beginning, it takes the same alpha for all iterations, and that is wrong
* in 'compareCPU': 
** print output in plain text file


Protocol:
* Equivalenz steepest decent == euler
* only one solution for cubic equation for alpha
