useless functions : 
	- improved_steepest (we just have to call steepest with the optimal alpha)
	- Gvalues
	- alpha
	- plotgraph
	- plotiterations
	- plotmethod

how to generate data
[b,h,c] 

- plotsteepest([4;-1], 0.0001, 10e-6, 1000) : plot the graph of the residual versus iterations for the three methods, the graph of g versus the iterations for the three methods and the graph of g with the iterations of steepest method with constant alpha, iteration of steepest with optimal alpha and newton method.

- newton and steepest calculates respectively the newton and steepest method

- newton_calcul and steepest_calcul calculate the same thing but they just help to calculate the cputime. So, they don't need to be in the report

- newton_steepest calculates the min with a combination of newton and steepest

- plotfunction plot the values of g, do not need to be in the report

- calcul calculates the cputime of each function, don't need to be in the report
